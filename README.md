PHP File Blog

=============

Blog engine written in PHP, using plaintext csv files instead of databases to store posts.

This is a very rough product and a proof-of-concept of how to accomplish a basic blog engine.  I don't recommend using this in production unless you just don't like the benefits of a relational database system, or unless you just want a buggy, basic, "look what I can do with PHP in under an hour" blog.
