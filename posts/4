<h3>I watched "In Time" today</h3>
<p>It was a wonderful mix of "Robin Hood" and "Bonnie+Clyde", with a sci-fi premise set in a dystopian future.  I liked it quite a bit.  I really just wrote this to demonstrate what happens with more than three posts. <br />
Oh, what happens, you ask?  Well, the homepage (index.php) only displays the first three posts, and there's a link to blog.php which, when visited without a "?post=" variable, displays all posts. </p>
