php-file-blog: a tiny PHP Blog engine without databases
=============

A stupid idea I had one evening: "I wonder if I can make my own blog engine from scratch in PHP, without using databases"... 

One frustrating hour later (Semicolons missing, I was just learning PHP at the time), This resulted.  

Now I'm finally bold (and unashamed) enough to post it on github, for the fool who would actually want to use it.
